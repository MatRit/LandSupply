**Abstract:**
This paper seeks to explain observed heterogeneity of liquidity in agricultural land markets. We adopt a real options model that determines the value of the opportunity to sell farmland and derives optimal disinvestment triggers. A proportional hazard model is applied to estimate the duration between land sales in Germany and to test implications from the real options model. In contrast to expectations, we find an ambiguous effect of return and price volatility on the optimal timing of land sales. Moreover, there is no evidence that non-agricultural investors buy and sell land more frequently compared to farmers. Our results contribute to the current discussion of land market regulations, such as the capping of land prices. According to our results, such policies could increase the rent-price ratio and thus discourage landowners from selling land. In turn, the land supply would be reduced, causing further price pressure in farmland markets.
